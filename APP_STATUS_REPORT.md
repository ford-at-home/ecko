# üöÄ Echoes App Status Report

## üìä Current Deployment Status

### ‚úÖ What's Live and Working

#### Backend Infrastructure (CDK-Managed)
- **API**: `https://6oit6bohh3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/` ‚úÖ HEALTHY
- **Authentication**: Cognito User Pool configured and ready
- **Storage**: S3 bucket for audio + DynamoDB for metadata
- **Notifications**: EventBridge + SNS configured (not tested)

#### Frontend Access
- **HTTP**: `http://echoes-frontend-dev-418272766513.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com` ‚ö†Ô∏è (No microphone)
- **HTTPS**: `https://d2rnrthj5zqye2.cloudfront.net` ‚úÖ (Microphone enabled)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issues

1. **Infrastructure Split**:
   - Backend: Managed by CDK ‚úÖ
   - Frontend: Created manually via bash scripts ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - CloudFront: Created manually via CLI ‚ö†Ô∏è

2. **Potential Functionality Issues**:
   - Microphone permissions only work on HTTPS URL
   - Frontend/backend integration not fully tested
   - User registration/login flow not verified

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Core User Journey
- [ ] User can access the app at https://d2rnrthj5zqye2.cloudfront.net
- [ ] User can create an account
- [ ] User can log in
- [ ] User can record audio (10-30 seconds)
- [ ] User can tag emotions
- [ ] Audio uploads to S3 successfully
- [ ] User can view their echoes list
- [ ] User can play back echoes
- [ ] Emotion filtering works

### Technical Verification
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly validated
- [ ] S3 presigned URLs work
- [ ] DynamoDB queries return data
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Error handling works gracefully

## üîß To Fully Bring App to Life

### 1. Immediate Actions (Today)
```bash
# Test the app end-to-end
1. Visit: https://d2rnrthj5zqye2.cloudfront.net
2. Create a test account
3. Try recording an echo
4. Report any errors
```

### 2. Infrastructure Consolidation (This Week)
```bash
# Option A: Keep manual resources, document them
- Document the manual CloudFront + S3 setup
- Add to runbooks

# Option B: Migrate to CDK (Recommended)
cd cdk
cdk deploy Echoes-dev-Frontend Echoes-dev-Network
# Then migrate content and update URLs
```

### 3. Missing Features Check
- [ ] AI transcription (optional, in CDK but not tested)
- [ ] Push notifications (optional, infrastructure ready)
- [ ] Time-delayed echoes (EventBridge ready but not implemented)

### 4. Production Readiness
- [ ] Add monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Set up error alerting
- [ ] Configure backups
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Security review

## üéØ Next Steps Priority

### High Priority (App Functionality)
1. **Test core features** at https://d2rnrthj5zqye2.cloudfront.net
2. **Fix any broken functionality**
3. **Verify audio recording works**

### Medium Priority (Infrastructure)
1. **Consolidate infrastructure** under CDK
2. **Add CloudWatch monitoring**
3. **Set up CI/CD pipeline**

### Low Priority (Enhancements)
1. **Custom domain** (echoes.app)
2. **AI features** activation
3. **Mobile app** deployment

## üí° Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check API health
curl https://6oit6bohh3.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/health

# Check frontend
open https://d2rnrthj5zqye2.cloudfront.net

# Monitor logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/echoes-main-dev --follow --profile personal
```

## üö¶ Go-Live Status

**Current Status**: üü° **PARTIALLY LIVE**

The app infrastructure is deployed and accessible, but needs:
1. End-to-end testing
2. Bug fixes (if any found)
3. Infrastructure consolidation
4. Basic monitoring

**Estimated Time to Fully Live**: 
- Minimum (just testing/fixes): 1-2 hours
- Recommended (with CDK migration): 1-2 days
- Production-ready (with monitoring): 1 week

The app is **technically live** but needs validation that all features work correctly!
