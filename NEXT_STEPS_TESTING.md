## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### CORS Errors
```bash
# Check API Gateway CORS configuration
aws apigateway get-rest-api --rest-api-id 6oit6bohh3 --profile personal

# Check browser console for specific CORS errors
```

### Authentication Failures
```bash
# Check Lambda logs for auth errors
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/echoes-main-dev --follow --profile personal

# Verify Cognito configuration
aws cognito-idp describe-user-pool --user-pool-id us-east-1_5I2DeD01Z --profile personal
```

### S3 Upload Issues
```bash
# Check S3 bucket permissions
aws s3api get-bucket-cors --bucket echoes-audio-dev-418272766513 --profile personal

# Monitor Lambda logs during upload
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/echoes-main-dev --follow --profile personal
```

## 📊 Monitoring Commands

### Watch Real-time Logs
```bash
# API Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/echoes-main-dev --follow --profile personal

# Check DynamoDB for saved echoes
aws dynamodb scan --table-name EchoesTable-dev --profile personal
```

### Verify S3 Uploads
```bash
# List uploaded audio files
aws s3 ls s3://echoes-audio-dev-418272766513/ --recursive --profile personal
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

The deployment is successful when:
1. ✅ User can create account and verify email
2. ✅ User can log in with credentials
3. ✅ User can record audio (microphone access works)
4. ✅ Audio uploads successfully to S3
5. ✅ Echo metadata saves to DynamoDB
6. ✅ User can see and play back their echoes
7. ✅ Emotion filtering works correctly

## 🚨 If Things Don't Work

1. **Check deployment logs**
   ```bash
   ls -la deployment-logs/
   cat deployment-logs/deployment-*.log
   ```

2. **Verify environment variables**
   ```bash
   cat frontend/.env.production
   ```

3. **Check CloudFront distribution**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-cloudfront-status.sh
   ```

4. **Re-run frontend deployment**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/cdk-deploy-frontend.sh dev
   ```

## 📝 Final Notes

- The application is now fully automated and ready for testing
- All infrastructure is managed by CDK
- Configuration is dynamically generated
- Frontend connects to real backend services

**Time to test!** 🎉
